Biological signals are widely used to perform medical assessment for monitoring an extensive range of pathologies, usually related to cardio-vascular diseases. Among these, both PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are those more employed. PPG signals are an emerging non-invasive measurement technique used to study blood volume pulsations through the detection and analysis of the back-scattered optical radiation coming from the skin. ECG is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on the skin.

PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) is a signal obtained by a non-invasive low-cost optical technique which is becoming popular to provide information about the cardiovascular system. Several physiological parameters like heart pulse, respiratory rate, tissue perfusion and some vascular and cardiac disorders can be easily monitored via PPG. This makes PPG signals very appealing to assess vascular diseases, especially the effects of vascular aging, hypertension and atherosclerosis, providing also information on arterial stiffness and elasticity
